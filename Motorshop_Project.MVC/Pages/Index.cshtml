    <h4>
        This web application is an admin interface for a fictional motorcycle dealership.
        Here you can easily manage brands, models, extras, and orders.
    </h4>

    <h4>
        The system allows you to add new motorcycle brands and models, upload images,
        and track or manage customer orders. Each model can have a name, type, price,
        and optional extras that customers can choose from during the ordering process.
    </h4>

    <h4>
        The models section helps you keep track of the different motorcycles in your catalog,
        organize them by brand, and specify detailed information so customers and staff
        always have up-to-date data.
    </h4>

    <h4>
        Use the menu above to explore the features and try out the administration tools.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        The system includes user roles: admins can see all fields and perform every action,
        while regular users have limited access (e.g., they can only view details or create new orders).
        Guests can only browse tables and items without making changes.

        Note: Debugging work is still pending.<br />
        Tip: You can promote users to admin via the /admin page on localhost.
