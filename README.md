# MotorShop_Project

This project was created as part of a university semester assignment. Its goal was to simulate the basic functionality of a motorcycle shop. The focus was on database management, using .NET technologies, and applying a layered architecture.

Main Features
CRUD operations: The application supports the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions.

Entity Framework: Data access and management are handled through Entity Framework, using a relational database.

Layered architecture: The codebase is divided into multiple layers (data access, business logic, presentation), as required by the course.

ASP.NET interface: The project started as a simple console application, and in the following semester, a basic ASP.NET web interface was added.

Non-CRUD features: In addition to standard CRUD, the project includes extra logic such as search, filtering, and basic statistics.

Personal Note
This was one of my favorite university projects. I’ve often wanted to revisit and rewrite parts of it. The core idea worked well, but over time, I’ve found several aspects I would now approach differently. Still, it was a great learning experience in .NET and database handling.
